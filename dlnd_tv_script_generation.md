# TV Script Generation

In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Get the Data

The data is already provided for you in `./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt` and you're encouraged to open that file and look at the text. 
>* As a first step, we'll load in this data and look at some samples. 
* Then, you'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script!


```python

data_dir = './data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt'
text = helper.load_data(data_dir)
```

## Explore the Data
Play around with `view_line_range` to view different parts of the data. This will give you a sense of the data you'll be working with. You can see, for example, that it is all lowercase text, and each new line of dialogue is separated by a newline character `\n`.


```python
view_line_range = (0, 10)

print('Roughly the number of unique words: {}'.format(len({word: None for word in text.split()})))

lines = text.split('\n')
print('Number of lines: {}'.format(len(lines)))
word_count_line = [len(line.split()) for line in lines]
print('Average number of words in each line: {}'.format(np.average(word_count_line)))

## Implement Pre-processing Functions
The first thing to do to any dataset is pre-processing.  Implement the following pre-processing functions below:
- Lookup Table
- Tokenize Punctuation

### Lookup Table
To create a word embedding, you first need to transform the words to ids.  In this function, create two dictionaries:
- Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call `vocab_to_int`
- Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call `int_to_vocab`

Return these dictionaries in the following **tuple** `(vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)`


```python
import problem_unittests as tests
from collections import Counter

def create_lookup_tables(text):
    """
    Create lookup tables for vocabulary
    :param text: The text of tv scripts split into words
    :return: A tuple of dicts (vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)
    """
    # TODO: Implement Function
    wCounts = Counter(text)
    sVocab = sorted(wCounts, key=wCounts.get, reverse=True)
    int_to_vocab = {ii: word for ii, word in enumerate(sVocab)}
    vocab_to_int = {word: ii for ii, word in int_to_vocab.items()}
    # return tuple
    return (vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab)

    


"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL THAT IS BELOW THIS LINE
"""
tests.test_create_lookup_tables(create_lookup_tables)
```

    Tests Passed


### Tokenize Punctuation
We'll be splitting the script into a word array using spaces as delimiters.  However, punctuations like periods and exclamation marks can create multiple ids for the same word. For example, "bye" and "bye!" would generate two different word ids.

Implement the function `token_lookup` to return a dict that will be used to tokenize symbols like "!" into "||Exclamation_Mark||".  Create a dictionary for the following symbols where the symbol is the key and value is the token:
- Period ( **.** )
- Comma ( **,** )
- Quotation Mark ( **"** )
- Semicolon ( **;** )
- Exclamation mark ( **!** )
- Question mark ( **?** )
- Left Parentheses ( **(** )
- Right Parentheses ( **)** )
- Dash ( **-** )
- Return ( **\n** )

This dictionary will be used to tokenize the symbols and add the delimiter (space) around it.  This separates each symbols as its own word, making it easier for the neural network to predict the next word. Make sure you don't use a value that could be confused as a word; for example, instead of using the value "dash", try using something like "||dash||".


```python
def token_lookup():
    """
    Generate a dict to turn punctuation into a token.
    :return: Tokenized dictionary where the key is the punctuation and the value is the token
    """
    # TODO: Implement Function
    tokens = {
        '.':'||PERIOD||',
        ',':'||COMMA||',
        '"':'||QUOTATION_MARK||',
        ';':'||SEMICOLON||',
        '!':'||EXCLAMATION_MARK||',
        '?':'||QUESTION_MARK||',
        '(':'||LEFT_PAREN||',
        ')':'||RIGHT_PAREN||',
        '-':'||DASH||',
        '\n':'||RETURN||'
    }
    
    return tokens   
    
"""

```

## Pre-process all the data and save it

Running the code cell below will pre-process all the data and save it to file. You're encouraged to lok at the code for `preprocess_and_save_data` in the `helpers.py` file to see what it's doing in detail, but you do not need to change this code.


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL
"""
# pre-process training data
helper.preprocess_and_save_data(data_dir, token_lookup, create_lookup_tables)
```

# Check Point
This is your first checkpoint. If you ever decide to come back to this notebook or have to restart the notebook, you can start from here. The preprocessed data has been saved to disk.


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL
"""
import helper
import problem_unittests as tests

int_text, vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab, token_dict = helper.load_preprocess()
```

## Build the Neural Network
In this section, you'll build the components necessary to build an RNN by implementing the RNN Module and forward and backpropagation functions.

### Check Access to GPU


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL
"""
import torch

# Check for a GPU
train_on_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()
if not train_on_gpu:
    print('No GPU found. Please use a GPU to train your neural network.')
    
print(train_on_gpu)
```

    True


## Input
Let's start with the preprocessed input data. We'll use [TensorDataset](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.TensorDataset) to provide a known format to our dataset; in combination with [DataLoader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), it will handle batching, shuffling, and other dataset iteration functions.

You can create data with TensorDataset by passing in feature and target tensors. Then create a DataLoader as usual.
```
data = TensorDataset(feature_tensors, target_tensors)
data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data, 
                                          batch_size=batch_size)
```

### Batching
Implement the `batch_data` function to batch `words` data into chunks of size `batch_size` using the `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader` classes.

>You can batch words using the DataLoader, but it will be up to you to create `feature_tensors` and `target_tensors` of the correct size and content for a given `sequence_length`.

For example, say we have these as input:
```
words = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
sequence_length = 4
```

Your first `feature_tensor` should contain the values:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
And the corresponding `target_tensor` should just be the next "word"/tokenized word value:
```
5
```
This should continue with the second `feature_tensor`, `target_tensor` being:
```
[2, 3, 4, 5]  # features
6             # target
```


```python
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

def batch_data(words, sequence_length, batch_size):
    """
    Batch the neural network data using DataLoader
    :param words: The word ids of the TV scripts
    :param sequence_length: The sequence length of each batch
    :param batch_size: The size of each batch; the number of sequences in a batch
    :return: DataLoader with batched data
    """
    # TODO: Implement function
    feature = []
    target = []
    for i in range(len(words)):
        if(len(words[i:i + sequence_length]) == sequence_length):
            feature.append(words[i : i + sequence_length]) 
            target.append(words[len(words)-1]) if ((i + sequence_length) >= len(words)) else target.append(words[i + sequence_length]) 
    
    
    feature_tensors = np.array(feature)
    
    target_tensors = np.array(target)
    
    data = TensorDataset(torch.from_numpy(feature_tensors), torch.from_numpy(target_tensors))
    data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(data,shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size)
    return data_loader

# there is no test for this function, but you are encouraged to create
# print statements and tests of your own

```

### Test your dataloader 

You'll have to modify this code to test a batching function, but it should look fairly similar.

Below, we're generating some test text data and defining a dataloader using the function you defined, above. Then, we are getting some sample batch of inputs `sample_x` and targets `sample_y` from our dataloader.

Your code should return something like the following (likely in a different order, if you shuffled your data):

```
torch.Size([10, 5])
tensor([[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32],
        [ 21,  22,  23,  24,  25],
        [ 17,  18,  19,  20,  21],
        [ 34,  35,  36,  37,  38],
        [ 11,  12,  13,  14,  15],
        [ 23,  24,  25,  26,  27],
        [  6,   7,   8,   9,  10],
        [ 38,  39,  40,  41,  42],
        [ 25,  26,  27,  28,  29],
        [  7,   8,   9,  10,  11]])

torch.Size([10])
tensor([ 33,  26,  22,  39,  16,  28,  11,  43,  30,  12])
```

### Sizes
Your sample_x should be of size `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or (10, 5) in this case and sample_y should just have one dimension: batch_size (10). 

### Values

You should also notice that the targets, sample_y, are the *next* value in the ordered test_text data. So, for an input sequence `[ 28,  29,  30,  31,  32]` that ends with the value `32`, the corresponding output should be `33`.


```python
# test dataloader

test_text = range(50)
t_loader = batch_data(test_text, sequence_length=5, batch_size=10)

data_iter = iter(t_loader)
sample_x, sample_y = data_iter.next()

print(sample_x.shape)
print(sample_x)
print()
print(sample_y.shape)
print(sample_y)
```

    torch.Size([10, 5])
    tensor([[ 42,  43,  44,  45,  46],
            [ 12,  13,  14,  15,  16],
            [ 21,  22,  23,  24,  25],
            [ 26,  27,  28,  29,  30],
            [  9,  10,  11,  12,  13],
            [  5,   6,   7,   8,   9],
            [ 27,  28,  29,  30,  31],
            [ 22,  23,  24,  25,  26],
            [ 44,  45,  46,  47,  48],
            [ 41,  42,  43,  44,  45]])
    
    torch.Size([10])
    tensor([ 47,  17,  26,  31,  14,  10,  32,  27,  49,  46])

## Build the Neural Network
Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:
 - `__init__` - The initialize function. 
 - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state
 - `forward` - Forward propagation function.
 
The initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.

**The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.

### Hints

1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`
2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:

```
# reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)
output = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)
# get last batch
out = output[:, -1]
```


```python

### Define forward and backpropagation

Use the RNN class you implemented to apply forward and back propagation. This function will be called, iteratively, in the training loop as follows:
```
loss = forward_back_prop(decoder, decoder_optimizer, criterion, inp, target)
```

And it should return the average loss over a batch and the hidden state returned by a call to `RNN(inp, hidden)`. Recall that you can get this loss by computing it, as usual, and calling `loss.item()`.

**If a GPU is available, you should move your data to that GPU device, here.**

## Neural Network Training

With the structure of the network complete and data ready to be fed in the neural network, it's time to train it.

### Train Loop

The training loop is implemented for you in the `train_decoder` function. This function will train the network over all the batches for the number of epochs given. The model progress will be shown every number of batches. This number is set with the `show_every_n_batches` parameter. You'll set this parameter along with other parameters in the next section.


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL
"""

def train_rnn(rnn, batch_size, optimizer, criterion, n_epochs, show_every_n_batches=100):
    batch_losses = []

    print("Training for %d epoch(s)..." % n_epochs)
    for epoch_i in range(1, n_epochs + 1):
        
        # initialize hidden state
        hidden = rnn.init_hidden(batch_size)

                batch_losses = []

    # returns a trained rnn
    return rnn
```

### Hyperparameters

Set and train the neural network with the following parameters:
- Set `sequence_length` to the length of a sequence.
- Set `batch_size` to the batch size.
- Set `num_epochs` to the number of epochs to train for.
- Set `learning_rate` to the learning rate for an Adam optimizer.
- Set `vocab_size` to the number of uniqe tokens in our vocabulary.
- Set `output_size` to the desired size of the output.
- Set `embedding_dim` to the embedding dimension; smaller than the vocab_size.
- Set `hidden_dim` to the hidden dimension of your RNN.
- Set `n_layers` to the number of layers/cells in your RNN.
- Set `show_every_n_batches` to the number of batches at which the neural network should print progress.

If the network isn't getting the desired results, tweak these parameters and/or the layers in the `RNN` class.

### Train
In the next cell, you'll train the neural network on the pre-processed data.  If you have a hard time getting a good loss, you may consider changing your hyperparameters. In general, you may get better results with larger hidden and n_layer dimensions, but larger models take a longer time to train. 
> **You should aim for a loss less than 3.5.** 

You should also experiment with different sequence lengths, which determine the size of the long range dependencies that a model can learn.

    Model Trained and Saved


### Question: How did you decide on your model hyperparameters? 
For example, did you try different sequence_lengths and find that one size made the model converge faster? What about your hidden_dim and n_layers; how did you decide on those?

**Answer:** I tried running for 15 epochs. but it was taking a lot of time to train.So, I reduced the no. of epochs to 10 but my GPU workspace used to disconect/sleep (the limit is 30 mins of inactivity). So i used the workspace_utilities.py file provided. But since it was still taking a lot of time to train I finally reduced no. of epochs to 5. Which was good enough for a Loss of less than "3.5".

I arbitrarily chose 150 as my sequence length initially but loss started with huge number. Then I thought if in a plot of TV Script a normal conversation would be minimum 5 words and maximum 10 words (maybe 20-25 if not a monologue? ) .So, I chose 10 as my sequence length this time. Although, model's training speed was slow but the loss started with very less number(5.11) and I reached objective of less than 3.5 ( EVEN BEFORE 5th Epoch!! ) . 

About the hidden dim I choose 512. Its a standard practice, we need to choose values in powers of 2 (i.e. 64,128,256,512) etc. More the value better the training.

About the n_layers, as we are using the LSTM cells its standard practice to use between 1-3 layers as we go more deeper there will high computational complexity but this is reverse in case of CNN. I used 2 as n_layers.
Moreover I wanted to Use Dropout & Because of Dropout Constraints n_layers must be >= 2

As expected, We get better results with larger hidden and n_layer dimensions, but larger models take a longer time to train

# Checkpoint

After running the above training cell, your model will be saved by name, `trained_rnn`, and if you save your notebook progress, **you can pause here and come back to this code at another time**. You can resume your progress by running the next cell, which will load in our word:id dictionaries _and_ load in your saved model by name!


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL 
"""
import torch
import helper
import problem_unittests as tests

_, vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab, token_dict = helper.load_preprocess()
trained_rnn = helper.load_model('./save/trained_rnn')
```

## Generate TV Script
With the network trained and saved, you'll use it to generate a new, "fake" Seinfeld TV script in this section.

### Generate Text
To generate the text, the network needs to start with a single word and repeat its predictions until it reaches a set length. You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!


```python

### Generate a New Script
It's time to generate the text. Set `gen_length` to the length of TV script you want to generate and set `prime_word` to one of the following to start the prediction:
- "jerry"
- "elaine"
- "george"
- "kramer"

You can set the prime word to _any word_ in our dictionary, but it's best to start with a name for generating a TV script. (You can also start with any other names you find in the original text file!)


```python
# run the cell multiple times to get different results!
gen_length = 400 # modify the length to your preference
prime_word = 'jerry' # name for starting the script

"""

pad_word = helper.SPECIAL_WORDS['PADDING']
generated_script = generate(trained_rnn, vocab_to_int[prime_word + ':'], int_to_vocab, token_dict, vocab_to_int[pad_word], gen_length)
print(generated_script)
```

#### Save your favorite scripts

Once you have a script that you like (or find interesting), save it to a text file!


```python
# save script to a text file
f =  open("generated_script_6.txt","w")
f.write(generated_script)
f.close()
```

# The TV Script is Not Perfect
It's ok if the TV script doesn't make perfect sense. It should look like alternating lines of dialogue, here is one such example of a few generated lines.

### Example generated script

>jerry: what about me?
>
>jerry: i don't have to wait.
>
>kramer:(to the sales table)
>
>elaine:(to jerry) hey, look at this, i'm a good doctor.
>
>newman:(to elaine) you think i have no idea of this...
>
>elaine: oh, you better take the phone, and he was a little nervous.
>
>kramer:(to the phone) hey, hey, jerry, i don't want to be a little bit.(to kramer and jerry) you can't.
>
>jerry: oh, yeah. i don't even know, i know.
>
>jerry:(to the phone) oh, i know.
>
>kramer:(laughing) you know...(to jerry) you don't know.

You can see that there are multiple characters that say (somewhat) complete sentences, but it doesn't have to be perfect! It takes quite a while to get good results, and often, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary (and discard uncommon words), or get more data.  The Seinfeld dataset is about 3.4 MB, which is big enough for our purposes; for script generation you'll want more than 1 MB of text, generally.
